# EcoFlow PS LFP Bridge

ESP32-based bridge that lets you connect a **generic LiFePO₄ pack with a JBD/Overkill BMS** to an **EcoFlow PowerStream** via CAN, and emulate a **Delta 2 battery** on the PowerStream’s battery port.

In short:  
**Any JBD LiFePO₄ pack → ESP32 LilyGO TCAN485 → EcoFlow PowerStream (thinks it's a Delta 2).**

This allows:

- PowerStream to **charge the external pack from PV**  
- PowerStream to **discharge from the pack into your AC loads**, just like with a real EcoFlow battery.

## Thanks

Many thanks to [@bulldog5046](https://github.com/bulldog5046) for kick-starting all of this - go look at the extensive details in  
[EcoFlow-CanBus-Reverse-Engineering](https://github.com/bulldog5046/EcoFlow-CanBus-Reverse-Engineering).

This project would have been considerably more difficult without the work done by [@stewartoallen](https://github.com/stewartoallen) on  
[wattzup](https://github.com/GridSpace/wattzup), which was invaluable for understanding and validating EcoFlow CAN behaviour.

## Hardware Required

* LilyGO T-CAN485 ESP32 board
* EcoFlow PowerStream
* LiFePO₄ battery with JBD / Overkill Solar BMS
* Suitable wiring and connectors (PS Battery Cable)

## WiFi Behaviour

- On boot:
  - Tries saved WiFi credentials (if any)
  - If connect fails or none saved → starts AP:
    - SSID: `EcoFlowBridge-XXXX` (XXXX = last 4 hex characters of MAC/deviceId)
    - AP IP: `192.168.4.1`
    - Password: same device-specific admin password printed on Serial
- Web UI available on AP IP or WiFi IP
- WiFi configuration stored

## CAN Messages - Delta 2

## MQTT & Home Assistant

- Configurable MQTT:
  - Host / port / user / password / base topic (default `ecoflow_bridge`)
  - Enable/disable MQTT
- Uses **Home Assistant MQTT Discovery**

## Wiring

* **PS**   -   **XT150**
* 1    -    5	     Wakeup?
* 2    -    6      Wakeup?
* 3    -    1      CAN +
* 4    -    2      CAN -
* 5&6  -    4      Battery Enable
* N/A  -    3      (Not Connected)
